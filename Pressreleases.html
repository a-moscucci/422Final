    <h2>Learn iOS through Wyncode!</h2>
    <h3>Wyncode adds it’s second cohort program for the advanced web developer</h3>
    <p>MIAMI – iOS is the world’s number one advanced operating system. Mobile devices offer an enormous platform for innovation. Now any advanced developer, with a background in CSS and HTML, can learn how to develop iOS apps at Wyncode. The $4,000 course meets three days per week: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is taught at Wyncode located at The Lab Miami (400 NW. 26 St. Miami, FL, 33127).</p>

  <p>“Miami is a great up-and-coming tech district and we are lucky to be the first coding boot camp to break ground. Our course combines best practices, based on other established boot camp programs with a focus on business skills, which allows us to create Miami’s next generation of developers," said Johanna Mikkola, Wyncode co-founder.</p>

  <p>The iOS course begins at the inception of an app and ends after six weeks with the deployment of the app in Apple’s App store.  The course is designed for junior developers that have either completed Wyncode’s immersive web development course, or can show a similar level of understanding.</p>
  <p>Karl Goodhew, director of development at YellowPepper, a leading mobile payments company teaches the course.  YellowPepper currently processes more than 30 million transactions per month for more than 5 million customers. The app is the leading mobile payment solution in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Before working at YellowPepper, Goodhew was a leading mobile architect for Home Depot in Atlanta, GA. This is just one example of a job similar to what a student might find after completing the Wyncode course.</p>

  <p>The program is taught on a Macbook or an iPad. For more information, please visit www.wyncode.co. Please email any questions to weare@wyncode.co or call us for more information (305) 720-2422.<p>
