    <h3>Wyncode Backgrounder</h3>

    <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p>Wyncode is the first coding boot camp accredited by the Florida Department of Education’s Commission for Independent Education. Wyncode is a nine-week long coding boot camp that teaches students the five most used coding languages: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The course is open to all students, from beginners to advanced. The course begins with the basics, and at the end of the nine-week course, students present a finished web application that showcases what they learned.</p>

    <h4>MISSION STATEMENT</h4>
        <p>We believe in promoting programming literacy using a disruptive education model and feel that a boot camp environment is the best way to learn practical and relevant coding skills quickly.</p>

        <p>Wyncode Academy separates itself from other coding boot camps by focusing on teaching coding skills and the business and leadership skills you need to succeed, whether you plan to start your own company or work for an established one. We are also the only boot camp located in the dynamic, up and coming tech hub of Miami, which is uniquely positioned to become a major tech center due to its entrepreneurial climate and close links to Latin America.</p>

      <h4>ABOUT THE PROGRAM</h4>
        <p>The day begins with a concept explained by an instructor and is followed by a practical example of how it is used. Then students are given time to apply this concept and practice. The end of the day is devoted to business development and mentoring sessions.</p>
